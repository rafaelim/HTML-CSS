At the first class we learn some concepts about html, css and somethings about SEO;

# CSS
    Was show to us how we could do a lot of things using only css. Ex: We can display an element only with css, that way we doesn't need to use any javscript code.

    With CSS3 we can make a regex to search some text in an element html and we saw a way to remove an element from screen but not from DOM;
    Example: 
    ```CSS
    a[href*="chriesler"] {
        position: absolute;
        left: -9999em;
    }
    ```
